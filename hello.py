 
#  functions print()
#  A part of your code that's used to cause an effect orevaluate a value

# can come from:
# * Python(built in functions)
# * Modules
# * Your own code

print ("Hello python!..")
print("Hello future Python Programmer!")
print("Python is a good language")
print("String don't get executed as code.")

# Function Execution

# python:

# 1. check function name
# 2. checks arguments passed
# 3. jumps into the function 
# 4. executed the function 
# 5. returns to your code
# 6. Resumes execution


print ("hello", "future", "python", "programmer")

print("Hello!",  end="")
print("Python is a great language.")

# - print()

# * built in function: can be used without importing it. 
# * Allows us to print values to the console
# * We can invoke it with parentheses
# * We can pass the value we want to print as arguments between the parantheses.
# * the backslash \ tells python that the next character has a special meaning (eg. \n)
# * keyboard arguments such as sep and end can be used to format the output.
